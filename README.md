# Twitter-News-Bot
This is a Python news bot for Twitter. It uses the GNews API to get news, the Telegram API for admin approval, and the x API (Twitter API) to post it on x.com.
This was made for personal use i am planning to add more features to it in near future.

# How to Use
1) Just edit the config.json file
2) Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install requirements
3) Run "python3 main.py"
4) Go to your telegram bot and start approving or rejecting the posts

Happy Tweeting...
